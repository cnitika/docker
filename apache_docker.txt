🔥 Hosting the Web in a Box: Apache Web Server in Docker

“What if I told you… you could run a full-blown Apache web server with just ONE command?”  
— Every Docker enthusiast ever

🧠 Why Apache?

Before NGINX stole the limelight, Apache was the king of web servers — and it still powers millions of websites today.

Why use Apache with Docker?
- 🧱 Portable web server setup
- 🚀 Quick experiments with HTML/PHP
- 🎒 Perfect for DevOps practice

🧰 What You’ll Need

- Docker installed (`docker --version`)
- Internet connection (to pull Apache image)
- A little curiosity and caffeine ☕ (optional)

🏗️ Step-by-Step: Apache in a Docker Container

🔹 Step 1: Pull the Official Apache Image
    docker pull httpd

🔹 Step 2: Run Apache on Port 8080
    docker run --name my-apache -p 8080:80 -d httpd

This command:
- Names the container `my-apache`
- Maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container
- Runs it in the background

🌐 Step 3: Visit Your Localhost
    http://localhost:8080

🎉 You should see the Apache welcome page.

🧪 Step 4: Customize Your Web Content

Create a local HTML file:
    mkdir apache-content
    echo "<h1>Hello from Apache inside Docker!</h1>" > apache-content/index.html

Run Apache with volume mounted:
    docker run --name custom-apache -p 8081:80 -v "$PWD/apache-content":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ -d httpd

Now visit:
    http://localhost:8081

🔍 Step 5: Check Logs & Container Info
    docker ps
    docker logs my-apache
    docker stop my-apache
    docker rm my-apache

🧼 Clean Up
    docker stop custom-apache
    docker rm custom-apache
    docker rmi httpd  # Optional
